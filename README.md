# ffmpeg-photosensitivity-gui
A friendly GUI to use the photosensitivity filter in FFmpeg.

## Requirements
### PyInstaller Builds
Download the latest from releases tab and ensure you meet [the PyInstaller system requirements.](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/requirements.html)<br>

### Downloading from source
To run, have the following installed:
* Python 3 (tested with 3.10)
* ffmpeg (tested with 2023-02-27)

## Issues and Plans
<p>There's still a few... okay, a lot of things to work out. If anyone knows how to handle these, please let me know.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Handling errors from ffmpeg.</b> This is the big one, and I really have no clue how to tackle it, unfortunately. I don't want to have to make the user decipher an ffmpeg log (not that the window stays up anyway... look into subprocess module for that.)
        <li>Cross-platform support. The main thing is dealing with how to handle finding and running ffmpeg when it isn't in your terminal by default. </li>
        <li>General code cleanup (better checks, separating into multiple modules, etc.)</li>
        <li>Profiles aren't in yet. Not anything to troubleshoot here, I'd just like to get the rest done before I add in bonus features.</li>
        <li>Not the prettiest since I made it by hand and didn't realize I could just use a wysiwyg editor (oopsie) and doesn't scale... at all. Sorry 4K monitor users</li>
        <li>A better name and any feature suggestions would be nice</li>
        <li>Make this manual more appealing with a less text-heavy approach... Cute TV head explaining things more visually and easily? Audio too, for accessibility if nothing else. We need more 90s vibes!!!</li>
    </ul>

## Final word
<p>I cobbled this together for me and my friends to watch some movies and shows that would be dangerous for me otherwise.</p>
<p>This is by no means a definitive answer to making media more accessible, of course. I <b>highly</b> encourage PRs, issue threads, and forks if necessary. If you couldn't tell, I kind of suck at UI design.</p>
<p>I also hope this raises some awareness about photosensitivity, and maybe even kickstart some more software development to make life easier for epileptics. Many similar projects haven't been updated in years, and I believe it's time for this sort of thing to get off the ground again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this project and reading to the end. :)</p>
